This is my first project, I aim to become a cybersecurity specialist after I graduate colloge so I am slowly creating projects one at a time.
This code I created is per request of my mom who runs a small foodchain. 
It tracks the expenses throughout the month.
I am still learning how to add calculations so that it can show the computation if their is profit or loss.
